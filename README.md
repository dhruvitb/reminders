# reminders

Set small reminders/TODOs that you don't necessarily know when you have time to get them done, just that you need to do them such as:

* call my parents back
* choose courses before November starts
* check that you meet all the graduation requirements
* email that person back about that thing

The reminders show as notifications that cannot be swiped away, so that you can't forget them! Clicking on the notification brings up
the reminder in the app, which is where you can remove it to also clear the notification.
